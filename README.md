# ToDo_List_with-User-Authentication

<p> TodoApp is a simple multi-user task management application for tracking personal to-do's within specific to-do lists created using Django.</p>
<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>Semantics behind TodoApp is based on a system where multiple users under management of an admin, can organize their personal to-do tasks within their special to-do lists.</p>
<p>Users can <code> Register </code>  to the system from <code> Register </code>  page (which is accessable through login page) and get started to using TodoApp directly from home page.</p>
<p> In <code> home page </code> users can display their current set to-do lists and some more related information about them as well as creating, editing or sorting them. Once a user has a to-do list, he/she can access its current set of to-do tasks within the options near that specific to-do list via todos page. </p>
<p> In todos page, users can display current not-done to-do's and also the already-done ones. In this page, users can create, edit, delete, sort or mark as done the to-do items.</p>
